# June 17th: 3D Modeled the Wooper Head

I started to 3D model the case for the robot in blender. I have never used blender before so it was kind of difficult to figure out how to use all the different modifiers and I probably ended up restarting it like 3 times because I didnt know how to revert all my changes. I tried to use different modifies such as shrinkwrap but I didn't really understand it so I just stuck with the basics of subdivision surface and mirror. I kept just using extrude and scale to resize and adjust the model until it looked a little bit like wooper and managed to finish the head today!
